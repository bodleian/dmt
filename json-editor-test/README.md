# Initial test 

## Description

Test using [JSON Editor](https://github.com/josdejong/jsoneditor)for the manipulation of the manuscripts. The tool allows editing JSON value-pairs, and drag-and-drop of sequences/canvas (in textual way). This folder will exist temporarily for reference only.

## Note

At the moment I'm working with [Manifesto](https://github.com/UniversalViewer/manifesto) - main updates on the DMT project at [https://github.com/bodleian/dmt](https://github.com/bodleian/dmt)
