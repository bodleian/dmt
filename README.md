# Digital Manuscript Toolkit - online manuscript editor
https://github.com/monicams/dmt

## Description

DMT online manuscript editor is a web-based tool to view, edit and format digital manuscript manifests created in JSON format. This tool is part of a larger toolkit using IIIF: http://iiif.io, an image server and many other tools. More updates on this tool will be published later on the [DMT project blog](http://dmt.bodleian.ox.ac.uk) and on [my blog](http://monicams.com/blog)

## Note

At the moment I'm working on the DMT online editor that is based on the [JSON Editor](https://github.com/josdejong/jsoneditor). More updates coming soon.
