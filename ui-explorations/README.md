# UI explorations - DMT

This folder was created to include UI/UX tests and other elements. This way the UI/UX ideas can move forward independently of other implementations until the project is finalised and put together. 


## Recommendation

Use a folder for specific milestones of UI. Such as: 

- drag-n-drop (all related to the drag and drop functionality)
- general-ui (UI elements such as buttons, icons, boxes, forms)
- style-guide (will be slowly formed by other elements)

and other folders as needed. The idea is not overwhelm the project with UI elements individually in folders, but to allow some independent work before it all comes together.
